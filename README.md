# Pigeon üïäÔ∏è
Pigeon is a simple chat application backend developed using C# .NET 8. This project was created to expand my programming skills and explore modern backend technologies.

## Technologies:
- **Web API** for core application functionality
- **SignalR** for real-time communication
- **Entity Framework** for database management
- **JWT Authentication** for secure user access
- **Swagger** for API documentation and testing
- **Apache Kafka** for message queuing and distributed event streaming [TODO]
- **Docker** to simplify deployment and containerization [TODO]
